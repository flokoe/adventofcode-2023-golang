# Advent of Code 2023 using Golang

My solutions (read attempts) for Advent of Code 2023 using Golang.

## Goals

- **Try to learn Go.** Most of my programming experience is based on dynamically
  typed languages. As an infrastructure person, it is almost impossible to avoid
  Go (which I don't mind), so I decided to give it a try.
- **Try to familiarize myself with TDD.** I like the concepts of
  docs/README-driven development. TDD sounds similar, and it is a built-in
  feature of Go.

## Progress
